Here is a MySQL table containing continent names, country names and their ISO-3166 codes. Was originally just posted at [my blog](http://www.geekality.net/?p=1182), but later moved it here.


**"The Story"**

Needed one a while ago, but the ones I found were either kind of lacking or kind of old. So I made one myself by converting a [datafile on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_soveriegn_states_and_dependent_territories_by_continent_(data_file)) into the format I wanted. Used some regular expressions and manual corrections. Later I also went through newsletters with [Updates on ISO 3166](http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/updates_on_iso_3166.htm). Hopefully I got it all right, and hopefully it can save you and others some time as well.

I have also subscribed to their updates and try to follow up when they change anything.

If you find any mistakes or updates I've missed, _please let me know_ :)
